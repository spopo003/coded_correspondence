# Project description

This was an excercise to show how encryption used to work. Given the message I firstly decoded using the ceasar cipher which was simply shifting each letter by a given (key) offset. Then I encoded using the same logic.

The second part of the excercise was using vigenere cipher. I would say it took me the same amount of work as ceasar. However, I understand that using this cipher it will be much harder to brake the encoded message without knowing the key phrase.
